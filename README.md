# Counting pitches

The notebook shows what we did in the 11/03 tutorial. To quickly produce the interactive `Plotly` plots you need to install cufflinks in your conda environment:

    conda install -c conda-forge cufflinks-py 
   
For using cufflinks, there is the one and only documentation: https://plot.ly/python/v3/ipython-notebooks/cufflinks/

In case the plots don't show in your notebook, you need ipywidgets: https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#jupyter-notebook-support

The same links has information for users of `Jupyter Lab` to get the `Plotly` plots running.

This excercise is supposed to bring you joy. If it doesn't, we are very sorry and hope that it will bring at least deeper insights.
